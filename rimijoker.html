  <p>
    Hi, I'm Anshuman!

    I am a final year student at SRM IST, Chennai, pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science.
    And also an optimistic, curious and well-focused developer.


    I am also a Google Summer of Code 2021 participant with DeepPavlov and Google Summer of Code 2020 participant with
    OpenMined.
    Here is my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v2AC4VE-3ZvvqYvXiLt9E8bD3vPKMWad/view">resume</a> link.


    I usually waste my time doing cool projects.
    Besides coding, I like photography and video games.<br />
    You can checkout my projects on my resume, but if you are more tech savvy,
    here is my <a href="https://github.com/rimijoker"> GitHub</a> link.
